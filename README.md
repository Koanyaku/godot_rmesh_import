## Godot 4.2+ Importer for RoomMesh (.rmesh) files.

Have you ever played [SCP ‚Äì Containment Breach](https://scpcbgame.com/)? Have you ever thought _"Hmm... I want to get these rooms into Godot, but they're in this weird .rmesh file format."_? If so, then this addon is just the thing you need!

This addon allows you to import this ancient file format officially supported by only one game into the Godot Engine. It supports .rmesh files from the original SCP ‚Äì Containment Breach game, and also files from [CBRE-EX](https://github.com/AnalogFeelings/cbre-ex), a free third-party map editor for the game.

### Some features:

- Importing rooms as either Godot's [Mesh](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_mesh.html) resource or [PackedScene](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packedscene.html) resource.
- Automatic collision generation.
- Automatic material application.
- Entity importing.
- Lightmaps aren't supported. Instead, you can import light entities.<br><br>

I highly suggest checking out these links, as you will find all information about the features there!

- [Importing SCP ‚Äì Containment Breach .rmesh files](docs/importing_scp-cb_files.md)
- [Importing CBRE-EX .rmesh files](docs/importing_cbre-ex_files.md)<br><br>

Some extra stuff...

- [SCP ‚Äì Containment Breach RMesh file format](docs/rmesh_format_scp-cb.md)
- [CBRE-EX RMesh file format](docs/rmesh_format_cbre-ex.md)<br><br>

Now, go wild! **_BUT!_** Read this first:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Before you download and install this addon, be aware that I only tested this addon with a few .rmesh files that I selected for both SCP ‚Äì CB and CBRE-EX. It should technically work with almost all .rmesh files, but exceptions always occur. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/Koanyaku/godot_rmesh_import/issues) if you encounter something unexpected. Also, I created this addon for Godot 4.2+, and RMesh files from either SCP ‚Äì Containment Breach v1.3.11 or CBRE-EX v2.1.0, and I don't know how this addon behaves with other Godot versions or RMesh files listed above.**
